# Data Visualization

Pick some relationship to look at in the Gapminder data and write up a .Rmd file investigating that question graphically. You might work with a subset of the data (e.g. just Africa). Upload both the `.Rmd` file and the `.html` file to Canvas. Include 4 to 8 graphs. All titles, axes, and legends should be labelled clearly (no raw variable names). You must have at least one graph with `facet_wrap` or `facet_grid`. You must include at least one manually specified legend. You can use other `geoms` like histograms, bar charts, add vertical or horizontal lines, etc. [You may find this data visualization cheat sheet helpful](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf).

Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization. You must write up your observations in words as well as showing the graphs. Use chunk options `echo` and `results` to limit the code/output you show in the `.html`.
